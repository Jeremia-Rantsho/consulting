                    <p>Mokoena and Mokoena Consulting; and as 100% black-owned and professionally run business.
                        The
                        decision to formally register the business was based on the decision by the owner to
                        enter the mainstream of the economy, after having identified a gap in the market for
                        the
                        supply and delivery of products and services that were much needed by the public and
                        private sector. We believe our business can offer our clients with products and
                        services
                        at a reasonable cost, superior quality and service.</p>

                    <p>It is envisaged Mokoena and Mokoena Consulting will grow from small operations, to be a
                        well-managed and profitable company that strives to empower the previously disadvantaged
                        communities through skills transfer, whilst providing reliable and efficient services to
                        their customers and improve the company bottom line.</p>

                    <p>In addition, the company will strive to be a business of choice within the public and
                        private sector. The business will thrive on the fact that it will create a rapport with
                        its clients who often refer business to us. Currently the business is looking for
                        avenues to grow its revenues and clientele.</p>

                <p>In an evolving world, where companies are competing for market share, human capital has
                    become the only resource that matters. Having competent and skillful employees is no
                    longer a target or policy instrument but a survival tool. As a qualified industrial
                    engineer, I have realized that training is not an expense for companies, but a lifetime
                    investment for the survival of future institutions.</p>

                business and handling money but she did not have clear idea of the
                financials until SEDA invited her to a financial management training that was
                facilitated
                by Mokoena and Mokoena Consulting. She made sure that she absord as much information she
                could from the training so
                that she can go back home and manage her business and personal finances better. "Mokoena
                mokoena facilitator made sure that they give us the tools to help us budget and
                manage our finances in a smart way, which is very crucial to know what you
                are doing when running a business. So I am really grateful to have attended that
